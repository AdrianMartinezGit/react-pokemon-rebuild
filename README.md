Pokemon API React Rebuild<br>
I used my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and ReactJS to create my own functioning and responsive Pokédex styled with the Tailwind CSS Framework, with the following features:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Display 1st - 5th Gen Pokémon [x]</li>
    <li>Search for Pokémon by name and Pokedex Number [x]</li>
    <li>Ability to get a Random Pokémon [x]</li>
    <li>Display both images of Pokémon and Shiny Form [x]</li>
    <li>Display Pokémon Name [x]</li>
    <li>Show 1 location from any game [x]</li>
    <li>Display Element Types [x]</li>
    <li>List all possible abilities and moves [x]</li>
    <li>Show Evolutionary Paths [x]</li>
    <li>Display Favorites List[x]</li>
    <li>Rebuilt with React Typescript</li>
</ul>

({Really well made, I couldn't find a way to break it either. My only complaint is the favorites button. I do wish the "Plus symbol" was a Start instead because it sorta was confusing. Other than that it was a pretty well made site. Well done!(also id recommend not making all the text bold)})
